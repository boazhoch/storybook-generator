## The problem

This repository was made as a solution to a problem I encounted in previous companies I had work with.
The problem was, that we already had a bunch of components and we wanted to start using storybook, but in order to use storybook, you would need to write lots of `story` file for each component, a tedious job when you have dozen or hundred of components.

## The solution
A quick stories file generator, it will create a story for each component.

## Notes
### This a very early MVP, thus it has it's limts.
* Only export default components will work.
* It create a story calling <Component /> just like that, not auto generating props on the fly.
* Currently has a hard coded template for creating a story file.

### Supports
* Passing exclude glob string.

### Next MVP version
* Able to pass your own template
* Generate props for components.
* Correlate exports from a component file to a story. (If you wrote many components in one file and named exported them)
* Testing
* Better documentino
